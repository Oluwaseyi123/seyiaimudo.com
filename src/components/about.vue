      My journey into web development started in 2020, driven by a fascination with how the web works. 
      I still remember how excited I was when I changed the color of a text for the first time—it felt like magic. 
      Since then, I've worked on a variety of projects (many of which are still on my local machine—if you're a software engineer, you'll understand!).
      <br> 
      I've had the opportunity to contribute to projects of all scales, from startups to medium-sized enterprises and large organizations. 
      Currently, I'm a Frontend Engineer at Raptor Technologies, where I continue to hone my skills and build impactful digital experiences.

      When I'm not writing code, you’ll find me either drafting blog posts (I promise to start publishing more of them soon!), on a tennis court, 
      reading a book, or indulging in content creation.

     I'm always open to collaborating on exciting new projects, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in building something great together!
